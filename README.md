# 60 Days of Code Challenge

## Dear Future Me,

This year has been overwhelming, but the greatest gift is that I'm still breathing. All glory to Yahweh for keeping me grounded and focused.

### Why This Challenge?
I haven't reached a significant milestone this year, and itâ€™s time to change that. I need something tangible to show for my efforts. This **60 Days of Code Challenge** marks the beginning of my journey to growth, improvement, and achieving my personal and professional goals.

### Goals for the Next 60 Days:
1. **Code** daily for at least 60 minutes.
2. **Meditate** for at least 30 minutes each day.
3. **Track** my daily activities via Google Sheets.
4. **Read** a book for at least 60 minutes every day.
5. **Exercise** for at least 60 minutes daily.
6. **Start the day with a prayer** to stay grounded and focused.
7. **Use AI tools** to track and analyze my progress.
8. **Document my progress on LinkedIn** by Day 5.

### My Focus:
- **As a Web Developer**: I'll create projects that showcase my skills and solve real-world problems.
- **As a Virtual Assistant**: Iâ€™ll work on standing out in the market by reaching out to clients and improving my skills daily.
- **As a Content Writer**: Iâ€™ll write and publish more blogs, engage my audience, and maintain an up-to-date portfolio.

### Resources I Plan to Use:
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- [FreeCode Camp](freecodecamp.org)

### Checklist & Progress Tracking:
I'll maintain a daily checklist on Google Sheets, where I can monitor and track my activities for the next 60 days. 

### Progress Updates:
I'll be sharing my daily progress on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/timothy-mwangi/) starting on **Day 5**. My GitHub repository will also be updated regularly with my coding projects.
